 - `Dfinder` is a local file browser made with `Java`, which searches through files (according to the user's choice) and then generates a txt file containing the search results.
 - 🤝 This project was carried out in collaboration with `@isbainemohamed` **isbainemouhamed@gmail.com** 
 - 🤔 In case of problem while running the application, `make sure to add the jar files (included in jars.rar ) in the project`.
 - 📝 The application report is the file: `Rapport PFA Dfinder.pdf`
 - 📫 Feel free to contact me if anything is wrong or if anything needs to be changed 😎!  **labrijisaad@gmail.com**
