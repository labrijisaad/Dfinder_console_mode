# `Dfinder console mode`
 - `Dfinder` is a local file browser, which searches through files (according to the user's choice) and then generates a txt file containing the search results.
 - This project was carried out in collaboration with @isbainemohamed
 - In case of problem while running the application, `make sure to add the jar files (included in jars.rar ) in the project`.
